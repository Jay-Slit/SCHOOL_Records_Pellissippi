Network Fundamentals
-Purpose: make a connection between one or more devices
-Value: traffic in a network
-Applications can be of various types, creating a converged network

Network Components
-Client: The device an end user uses to access the network
-Server: serves up resources to the network
-Hub: Older technology that provides connection ports for network devices
-Switch: Performs like an intelligent hub. It takes traffic in on one port and sends it out to the appropriate port(Uses learned MAC Addresses)
-Router: An intelligent device that forwards traffic to the appropriate interface based on logical network address(IP addressing)
-Media: The means for making the connectivity between the devices(Actual path for signal transmission)

Network Geographies
-Local Area Network(LAN)
--Interconnects network components with in a local area such as a building
-Wide Area Network(WAN)
-Campus Area Network(CAN)
--Interconnected LANs located in buildings across the enterprise site
-Metropolitan Area Network(MAN)
--More Widespread than a CAN and not as widespread as a WAN
-Home Area Network(HAN)
--A network in home that connects devices for productivity, entertainment, etc.
-Personal Area Network(PAN)
--Range typically limited to a few meters

Network Topologies
-Topology refers to the layout of a network and how different devices in a network are connected to each other

-Bus Topology
--One long cable that devices tap into for connection
---requires splitters
-Ring Topology
--Traffic flows in a circular fashion around a closed network loop
---each device accesses the information until the information reaches the correct device
-Star Topology
--Physical LAN topology in use today with an ethernet switch at the center and a UTP cable connection to each client
---Most Popular
-Hub-And-Spoke Topology
--Used for connecting remote sites(spokes) to a main site(hub) with WAN links
-Full-Mesh Topology
--Directly connects every site to every other site with WAN links.
--Number of node links has the formula n(n-1)/2
-Partial-Mesh Topology
--A hybrid of the HAS and the Full-Mesh. WAN links support the traffic volume between sites

Networks by Resource Location
-Peer-To-Peer
--each device connects to another device and shares files directly
