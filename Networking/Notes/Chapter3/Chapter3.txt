Media Types
-Coaxial Cable
--Two Conductors
---Centre Conductor
---Dielectric Insulator Between the two
---Foil Shield
--Used mostly as a media for cable modems today
--Two Common Connectors
---BNC (Bayonet Neil-Concealman)
---F-Connector
-Twisted Pair Cable
--Shielded Twisted Pair
---Metallic shielding similar to coaxial cable to help prevent EMI reception or transmission
---More costly due to shielding
---Used in environments that may be susceptible to electrical currents
--Unshielded Twisted Pair
---Pair strands wrapped more tightly (more twists per centimeter) and the wires insulate each other from EMI
---Less expensive than STP
---Three Connector Types
----RJ-45 (Ethernet Cables)
----RJ-11 (Telephones)
----DB-9 (Serial computer connections)
-Fiber-Optic Cable
--Uses light instead of electricity
--Immune to EMI
--Greater range than copper
--Greater data-carrying capacity
--Two Modes
---Multimode Fiber(MMF)
----Two strands of glass: and inner core surrounded by an outer cladding of a different type of glass
---Single-Mode Fiber(SMF)
----Inner core has a diameter so small that only one mode or one path of propagation is permitted
---SMF costs more to manufacture than MMF but can be used over a greater distance
--Path of light pulse is called the Mode of Propogation and can represent the value of a bit
--Connector Types
---ST-ST
---SC-SC
---LC-LC
---MT-RJ - MT-RJ
-Wireless Technologies

Terminology
-Passive (does not amplify incoming bits)
-Active (regenerates incoming bits)
-Smart
-ARP - Address Request Protocol


Network Infrastructure Devices
-Hubs
--Layer 1
--Passive
-Bridges
--Layer 2
--Join two or more LAN devices
--Replaced by switches
-Switches
--Layer 2
--Dynamically learns the MAC addresses of attached devices to populate its address table
-Routers
--Layer 3 (forwarding decisions based on IP address)
--Capable of considering higher-level layer parameters
--Normally has a broader range of interface types than a multilayer switch

Learn These:
-Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
-Firewall Appliances
-Proxy Servers
-Virtual Private Network (VPN)
-Voice Over IP Protocols (VoIP)
-Domain Name System (DNS)

Ethernet Technology
-Collision Domains
--associated with Ethernet hubs and bridges or any type ethernet segment
--The greater the number of devices in a collision domain the higher the chance for collisions to occur.
--Collisions were alleviated somewhat by using the *carrier sense multiple access collision detect* procedure
-Broadcast Domains
--Range of a device's broadcast
