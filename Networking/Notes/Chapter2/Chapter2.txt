Network Protocols
-Devices can all share data as long as they all speak the same language, or protocol
-Protocol: A set of rules, or an agreement, that determines the format and the transmission of data
--Internet Protocol: the "language" the internet speaks
---The internet actually uses a group, or suite, of protocols called the TCP/IP

Standardization
-To assess the problem of standardization, the Organization for Standardization(ISO) researched the leading network schemes:
--Digital's DECnet
--IBM's SNA
--DoD's TCP/IP(non-proprietary)
-The ISO recognized there was a need to create a network model that would help vendors create a modernized network

OSI Reference Model
-A Layered Model
--Application
---Network processes to applications
--Presentation
---Data representation
--Session
---Interhost communication
--Transport
---End-to-End connections
--Network
---Addresses and best path
--Data Link
---Access to media
--Physical
---Binary Transmission

Host Layers
-Provide accurate transport to the user
--Application
--Presentation
--Session
--Transport

Media Layers
-These control physical delivery of messages over the network.
--Network
--Data Link
--Physical

-Open System Interconnection
--Reduces Complexity
--Standardizes Interfaces
--Facilitates modular engineering
--Ensures interoperable technology
--Accelerates evolution
--Simplifies teaching and learning

Data Encapsulation
-A packaging system to keep information data together while in transfer
--Transport packages into a Segment Header, creating a Segment
--Network adds a Network Header, creating a Packet
--Data Link adds a Frame Header and a Frame Trailer, creating a Frame
--Physical transfers information

TCP/IP Model
-Application
-Transport
-Network
-Host to Network

Windowing
-Window Size
--How many segments can be sent in one transfer
--Determined by a try-test acknowledgement between sender and receiver
